## File Metadata Microservice
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to 
[this](https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com).
 Then deploy it to Glitch.<br>
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch 
project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit 
[this](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).<br>
<br>
Here are the specific <b><i>user stories</i></b> you should implement for this project:
<br>
 - I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
 - When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response.
